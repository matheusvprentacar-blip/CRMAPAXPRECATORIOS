## Deploy

## Update Release (Tauri Updater)

Use this command when you want to publish an app update:

```bash
npm run release:update
```

What it does:
- bumps app version (patch),
- syncs version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`,
- creates commit and tag `vX.Y.Z`,
- pushes branch + tag to `origin`.

After tag push, GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) publishes release assets used by the Tauri updater.

Optional:

```bash
# fixed version
npm run release:update -- -Version 1.7.0

# semver bump
npm run release:update:minor
npm run release:update:major
```
